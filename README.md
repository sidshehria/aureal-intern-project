We define the configuration object for our Phaser game, specifying the width, height, and the scenes for preload, create, and update functions.

In the preload function, you can load your game assets, such as images, sounds, etc. In this example, we load a background image and a button image.

In the create function, we display the loading screen background and create a start button. We make the button interactive and define an event to transition to the menu screen when it is clicked.

The update function is where you would put your game's update logic. In this simple example, it's left empty.
